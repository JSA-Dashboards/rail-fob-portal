"""
Each railroad's mileage-based grain fuel surcharge, in dollars per car-mile (researched 2026-10-28).

All five key off the monthly average of EIA's weekly US on-highway diesel (the railroads call it HDF) with a
two-month lag — diesel for month M sets the surcharge for month M+2 — and differ in strike, step and rounding:

    BN   strike 3.25  1c per 5c   round up each started step   (fitted; BNSF's rule text isn't public — bn_fsc.py)
    UP   strike 2.30  1c per 5c   full steps only, plus a 5c base   (UP's own page, table checked)
    NS   strike 2.50  1c per 4c   round up, diesel truncated to the cent first   (NS's page; the rounding is inferred)
    CN   strike 2.30  0.575c per 2.5c   round up   (CN 7403 on CN's page; lag and rounding inferred)
    CSX  strike ~3.749  1c per 4c   round up   (INFERRED from the June 2026 surcharge and a third-party calculator;
                                                CSX's own page wasn't readable)

`published` are the surcharges each railroad's page (or the USDA AMS Grain Transportation Report) showed when this was
written — what tests/test_rail_fsc.py reproduces from the diesel prices. Whether a given railroad's grain shuttles move
under these public programs rather than a contract one was not verified for UP, NS or CSX.
