UP origin spreads (Kolten, 2026-11-02, from his own description of how UP origins trade):

  * Group 3 is based off North Bend, NE; Interior IA off Joice, IA. Interior IA typically trades an 8c DISCOUNT to Group 3.
  * Some IA / MN origins spread off Group 3 at a smaller discount than that paper spread, so they trade Group 3 and apply the lesser
    discount: Brewster and Heron Lake MN trade 3c off Group 3 AND 3c off Interior IA (so mostly Group 3), Savage MN 12c off Group 3 /
    7c off Interior IA, Sloan IA 3c off Group 3; Randolph MN 8c, Hope MN 7c and Welcome MN 6c off Interior IA.
  * Most other IA origins are par or a small discount to Interior IA, most other Nebraska origins par or a small discount to Group 3
    (the small discount isn't stated, so it is taken as par).
  * Allen Station (IL) is posted as its own bids: typically 20c better than Interior IA to Mexico and about 30c to domestic destinations.

So an origin's FOB is a base bid LESS its discount — the discount is the freight spread, like the CSX / NS ones — and an origin with
only one stated discount takes the other through the 8c paper spread. Pure functions; no Streamlit.
