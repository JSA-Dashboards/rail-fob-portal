"""
State Level tab: the river / export rows as INDEXES, state by state (Kolten, 2026-11-09 onwards: "list out the average or indexed values for river using the Basis
Tracker ...; use the state ethanol index bids, not individuals"). Each cleaned-up state has its own spec here:

  IL  Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 5 and STL — the tracker's `delivery_zone` tags on its Illinois river terminals (Zones 2, 3 and 5), with STL (the St. Louis-area
      terminals) pulled OUT of the tracker's Zone 5, which lumps them with Havana / Beardstown / Meredosia, plus ADM Sauget (untagged). Terminals with no zone
      (the ADM ones, apart from Sauget) are in no group.
  IN  Evansville (ADM's four Evansville terminals and ADM Mt. Vernon) and Louisville (CGB Louisville, KY and CGB Jeffersonville, IN — the tracker types both as
      country elevators and has no Louisville river terminal).
  IA  Dubuque (ADM East Dubuque, ADM Grain — the only Dubuque location the tracker carries; it sits on the Illinois bank).
  OH  Toledo (ADM Toledo export terminal, the two Andersons Toledo elevators) and Cincinnati (Cargill's Kellogg and River Road).
  KS  Garden City region (every non-ethanol Kansas location the tracker has within 60 miles of Garden City) plus Northeast / Southwest Kansas ethanol indexes.
  NE  no river rows; Eastern / Central Nebraska ethanol indexes.

A group's index for a delivery month is the simple average of its locations' corn bids for it (a location's own bids for the month averaged first). Pure
functions plus the SQL; no Streamlit.
