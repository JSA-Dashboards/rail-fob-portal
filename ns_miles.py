"""
Extra rail miles behind the NS fuel surcharge (Kolten, 2026-10-28: "we need to add FSC for NS and CSX as well").

NS's freight in ns_freight_seed.json is a SPREAD to NS Ft Wayne, the one bid market (Ft Wayne = 0, a few origins east / south of
it negative), in $/bu to three destination regions (GA, NC/SC/VA, East). So the surcharge only enters as the DIFFERENCE in rail
miles to the destination between the origin and Ft Wayne:

    FOB(origin) = Ft Wayne bid - (spread + FSC $/car-mile x (miles(origin -> dest) - miles(Ft Wayne -> dest)) / bu per car x 100)

Nobody publishes those miles here, so they are estimated: great-circle miles to one representative town per region
(GA Gainesville, NC/SC/VA Greensboro, East Harrisburg) x 1.25 for rail circuity. Check: across the 66 seeded origins with
coordinates, the seed's spreads track that great-circle difference (R^2 0.7-0.8 per region), which is also what says the seed is a
spread to Ft Wayne; the representative towns and the 1.25 are judgement, so treat an estimate as rough (a few tens of miles ~ a
few tenths of a cent at NS's $/mile).

Pure functions; no Streamlit.
